 <h2>Deities & Mythology </h2>
 <i> Main article: <a href="Pantheon">Pantheon</a></i>
 <p class="desc">
While mythology tends to differ from area to area, most agree on the twofold nature of the godly Pantheon. The Morning Axon, the 4 primary Gods, have domain over Order, Chaos, Balance, and Power, as well as Earth, Sea, Nature, and Sky respectively. These fundamental units rule over the open Pantheon of the evening drove; a rough bunch of less powerful gods, who vary in domain from a single fishing town to luck and fate. The evening drove are often seen as vessels for the combinations of the primary powers of the Axon.
