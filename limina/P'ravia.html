  <h2> Overview </h2>
  <p class="desc">
P'ravia is a completely flat realm consisting of some continents, including the known ones of <a href="index.html"> Limina</a> and Duriel. Below the surface lies the Subetedawn Caverns, an underdark-esque network of caves and rock formations that hangs from P'ravia above the Evernight Pit.

   <h2> Astrology </h2>
   <p class="desc">
 P'ravia has 2 suns, known to the humans of Limina as Cronor (The Daylight Sun) and Tedaren (The Summerglow), and two moons, Juliarin (The Steadbright) and Arteminon, (The Wanderer). These are associated with their respective Gods. The downward acceleration of the creatures upon it is caused by the plane accelerating upwards at 10ms<sup>-2</sup>.

    </p>
    <p class="desc">
  Cronor revolves around the P'ravian continents roughly once every 25 hours, and has two sides. The upper surface of P'ravia only ever sees the bright light of Cronor's light side, but as the gods sleep, Cronor is extingiushed.
