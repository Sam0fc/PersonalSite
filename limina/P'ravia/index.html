  <h2> Overview </h2>
  <p class="desc">
P'ravia is a completely flat realm consisting of some continents, including the known ones of <a href="index.html"> Limina</a> and Duriel. Below the surface lies the Subetedawn Caverns, an underdark-esque network of caves and rock formations that hangs from P'ravia above the Evernight Pit.
   </p>
   <h2> Astrology </h2>
   <p class="desc">
 P'ravia has 2 suns, known to the humans of Limina as Cronor (The Daylight Sun) and Tedaren (The Summerglow), and two moons, Juliarin (The Steadbright) and Arteminon, (The Wanderer). These are associated with their respective Gods. The downward acceleration of the creatures upon it is caused by the plane accelerating upwards at 10ms<sup>-2</sup>.

    </p>
    <p class="desc">
  Cronor, the firey orange daylight sun, revolves around the P'ravian continents roughly once every 25 hours. The upper surface of P'ravia only ever sees the bright light of Cronor's light side, but as the gods sleep, Cronor is extingiushed, and the Subetedawn caverns remain dark. The daily clock is set by the passage of Cronor through the sky.
   </p>
   <p class="desc">
 Tedaren revolves around P'ravia about once every 400 Cronor Days, and the dim glow of the white-yellow sun is what causes the seasonal change in climate; it is highest in the sky during the summer season (which varies slightly in intesity based on location), and then dissapears below the plane of P'ravia in the winter. It bathes the exposed areas of the caverns in a dim light for the second half of the year, and in many cultures, the Tedaren's Rising, (commonly known as the Dawncrest) is an important holiday.
