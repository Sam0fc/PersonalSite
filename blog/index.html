  <p> The ramblings of a slightly insane student. </p>
  <div class="post">
    <a id="1"></a>
    <h2 >This isn't twitter...</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>and that's a good thing</strong>. I've had a few blogs before,
      (though obviously very <a href="http://samwritescode.blogspot.com">cringe</a> ones!), but the thing that finally prompted
      me into setting this up was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYj3DnI81AQ">
        this</a> Tom Scott<sup><a href=#1foot1>1</a></sup> video; it was mentioned that Tom of the past didn't even consider how
      centralised the internet would become. Nowadays it seems almost a relic of the past that people would have their own websites.
      Things are on Discord, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Tumblr, TikTok, and that's about it.
    </p><p>
      There's that running joke online that all content just gets reposted as lower quality jpeg screenshots ad nauseam,<sup><a href=#1foot2>2</a></sup> which is
      is not entirely incorrect. It seems almost obvious that this stems from the incentive towards monopoly - it might be slightly early in the life of this blog
      (paragraph 2!) to go into the failing of capitalism - but needless to say, as the internet became much more mainstream, and corporations rushed to capitalise
      on it, it was much more profitable to attempt to co-opt people into one platform at a time, and use all incentives to keep them on there. YouTube for example,
      discourages videos that significantly direct people off-platform. They don't want to be part of the wide free web, they want their platform to be the only thing
      you interact with.
    </p><p>
      I am, of course, also guilty of this; TikTok, Discord, YouTube and Twitter are (in that order) by far the majority of the non-work related websites I access.
      They do make it convenient to talk to your friends, or watch content that you expect; they have the wide user-base and money that allows them to do so. I mean it is clear that the average
      "creator" doesn't start with enough capital, technical knowledge and/or media presence to make a name for themself off of these platforms. I recall a phrase from
      somewhere: "It would be prohibitively expensive to host as much high quality video as YouTube, unless you also happen to run the largest advertising company in the world."
      Of course, this is exactly what Google does. They make it possible to have the era of the individual creator, at the expense of the data, time, and unpaid labour of millions.
    </p><p>
      Let me expand slightly on that last point: Yes, creators do make money. The ones that have the influence to. Maybe not clear to all, but to anyone immersed in this
      new internet culture, the concept of "making a living" from being an influencer is no trivial detail. Some money can come from the service on which the content
      is hosted; the YouTube ad revenue or the TikTok creator fund do exist, after all, but it seems that even the larger producers of content have to take sponsorships,
      promote their Patreons,<sup><a href=#1foot3>3</a></sup> and do merch or other sales. For the vast majority of "content" produced in the modern day, whether this be
      something "advertiser unfriendly" or just coming from one of the innumberable people who don't have the requisite large amount of followers to make money, that work simply
      does not pay the creator.
    </p><p>
      In a very real sense, the work of millions of people is exploited by these big tech companies, that rely on that steady stream of content for the continued survival
      of their services. My friends don't get paid to make a post on Instagram, but the only reason that Instagram can exist is because I spend my time scrolling past advertising that subliminally
      convinces me to buy a metal wallhanging<sup><a href=#1foot4>4</a></sup>. There is the obvious response to this that "this content wouldn't exist without this platform",
      which seems reasonable to begin with, but on the slightest further examination completely falls apart.
    </p><p>
      People put creative energy into things other than social media platforms. That's a wild idea isn't it. The people who take a photo to post it on Instagram could
      always have posted it to their friends, put it on their fridge for people to see when they come round, or more recently, put them on their blog, sent it to a large
      email list or done literally anything else. Instagram did not invent the photograph, YouTube did not invent the video, Twitter did not invent short format text, yet
      somehow people link any post on any of these intrinsically to the platform on which it is shared.
    </p><p>
      To actually return from the general ramblings to my issue with this: the problem is that the public square, the noticeboard in the frontier town of the internet has been bought. Private companies now have the power to control the public
      discourse in a way that infinitely limits the amount of creativity and freedom that the average person can express. Now one of the very few ways to get eyes on things that
      you make is to present those things on the stage owned by others.
    </p><p>
      <strong>The internet had immense potential.</strong> It seemed to provide some level of equality,<sup><a href=#1foot5>5</a></sup> the blogosphere distributing opinions and thoughts to millions of
      different formats and identities, from each person's own site of their own creation in their own format. It might seem naive to think that this could be stable, but I firmly believe that with better
      education and tools that were not liable to the capitalist incentives; i.e. a variety of search engines that could lead you to smaller sites, we could at least try to make the internet
      a more open and more free place, rather than it all being at the behest of a few companies. Even aside from that noble goal of free internet, I just think it's more interesting when
      the internet is more diverse, and not just an increasingly jpeggified group of screenshots.
    </p><p>
      So, this is my small corner of the internet! Welcome! I hope I'm adding to that sort of fun diversity that only the internet can provide :)

      <li>Yes, I know, referencing a big YouTube person in a post about web freedom, bit cringe.
        If you haven't heard of him or his stuff, do check it out. He's got funny and good informative content. A bit sanitised maybe and
      very rarely explicitly political.</li>
      <a id="1foot2"</a>
      <li>Like this: [sam remember to add the image you're thinking of later]</li>
      <a id="1foot3"</a>
      <li>I actually much prefer Patreon as a way of compensating creators and artists, but that is entirely a topic for another time. Funding the artist instead
      of paying for the work, not only means that we don't have to as strongly protect the copyright of the work once created, (attribution being the only
      neccessary part), but also more directly contradicts the effects of alienation; you think directly about the producer to whom you're giving your money.
      Clearly this footnote cannot contain a complete theory of a post-copyright world, so I will return to actually writing the post now!</li>
      <a id="1foot4"</a>
      <li>Clearly the masculine equivalent of those huge geometric pattern tapestries that seem to be in every femme person's room</li>
      <a id="1foot5"</a>
      <li>I recognise here that I am speaking from a position of privilege, on the right side of the digitial divide. Nonetheless, with equitable access to
      the internet, communication becomes possible between anyone, everyone. Knowledge can be shared in a way that doesn't priorities locations with power.</li>
