   <meta name="description" content="We are a student-run non-profit organization that aims to reduce the disparity in education by volunteer tutoring K-5 underprivileged students. We provide individualized tutoring and homework help at absolutely no cost: each tutor works with just one student at a time, ensuring they receive enough support to be able to ask questions at any time, as well as become confident in their abilities. Whether it be online or in person, our tutors are committed to bringing the best possible experience to students. Though our primary purpose is to help students with their classwork, personal connections are just as important as academic success. Our goal is to not only help students learn the material, but help them stay engaged and interested. ">

        <img class="headpic" src="head+shoulders.png">
        <p> Hi! I’m Sam, (any pronouns) a first year NatSci, deeply concerned about the state of the climate.</p>
      </div>
        <ul class="bulletlist">
          <li>IT officer and Social Media Manager at the climate non-profit “La Révolution Albatros” </li>
          <p class = "weakexpl"> My experience at RA was the first time I really got into climate activism. I learnt how to work within that structure, and how to grow and maintain interest in our projects. This sort of "awareness-raising" activism spirit is what I hope to bring to JCR! </p>
          <li> 2019 Climate Strike Organiser with “Fridays for Future” San Francisco </li>
          <p class ="weakexpl">This was the most fun! Essentially, me and a group of friends skipped school. I had registered as a Fridays for Future organiser, put out a facebook group, and we joined up with the larger protest in San Francisco. I organised sign-making, chants, and for a group of us to take the train into the city. This really fed into the on-the-ground real activism that I want to bring to Selwyn.</p>
 <li> Politically and personally conscious of how immediate action is crucial.</li>
 <p class = "weakexpl"> yes i ran out of actually relevant things to put here. so this is what you get. I mean, I am vegan, super passionate (read: annoying) about recycling, and have read a LOT about the climate. I'm also doing Earth Sciences, so it's really depressing seeing the same few climate graphs pop up...</p>

          <ul class="bulletlist2">
            <li>Improve the quality and variety of vegetarian and vegan options.</li>
            <li>Lower the cost of plant-based meals.</li>

            <p class = "weakexpl"> I mean, selfishly, as a vegan, this is pretty much me fixing my gripes with hall food. But, yes, while having 1 vegan option is great, I know that some days I don't want to have the "vegan mac & cheese" or somehow that same bean stew for the third day in a row. Especially not when I'm paying the same amount as meat-eaters, whose food is more expensive to purchase and prepare. I hope to make the vegan food in hall good enough that meat-eaters think "wow that looks great, I'll get that", and at the same time decrease their impact on the climate. </p>
            <li>Increase provisions for self-catering</li>

            <p class = "weakexpl"> And for times when you don't want to go to hall, especially when you're eating on a reduced budget, or within dietary restrictions, it can be more environmentally friendly to make your own meals. I would work with other officers to make Selwyn more friendly to people cooking their own food, especially if the food in hall doesn't improve. </p>
            <li> Provide larger compost bins and campaign for compost collection  </li>
            <p class ="weakexpl">The current JCR offers compost caddies on request, but in my experience their size, and the fact that you have to empty them yourself, (where you do not have to do so for other bins), prevents people from requesting and using them. I hope to get the college on board in providing proper compost collection. Cambridge council even collects it, so it is exactly the same process as other bins!</p>
            <li> Faciliate a clothes-swap system to recylce formal clothes </li>
            <p class ="weakexpl">Cambridge uses a LOT of formal clothes, and these have a big impact on both the climate and on waste. I hope to implement a system where people can get second hand clothes, affordably, and thereby prevent them from having to buy new. </p>

          <div class = "policyinternal">
            <ul class="bulletlist">
              <li>Publish yearly reports of the JCR's environmental impact, and encourage college to do the same.</li>
              <p class = "weakexpl"> Well yea, bit of a no-brainer. The first thing I did when I was researching for this position was google "Selwyn sustainability", and other than a few random facebook posts, and articles about the recent divestment, nothing came up. I want Selwyn to be PROUD of our environmental impact (or lack thereof), so we need to be able to see it. </p>
              <li>Add signage showing the origin of our food in hall.</li>

              <p class = "weakexpl">Food that comes from further away incurs a lot of Carbon output because of transport. If we can see that, we can make more choices about our personal output. I want to work with catering to make it clear when we are getting locally sourced ingredients, and show that to students.</li>
              <li>Build a Green JCR webpage, collating petitions and information </li>
              <p class ="weakexpl">Well basically all the information about being sustainable is super scattered, random posts on facebook, emails, etc. If there's one place, it makes it so much easier for us to be conscious of our sustainability. Additionally it makes it easier for us to collaborate on larger goals, through protest or letters. As much as we should try to limit our personal impact, the much greater problem is big corporations, governments and other bodies that we can only effect through numbers. </p>
              <li> Ensure Green policies are ethical and intersectional. </li>
              <p class ="weakexpl">Yep, those are big words. Intersectionality means that we don't put in place policies that disproportionally target minority-power groups. Often with environmentalism, we fall into classism and ableism. A lot of people need plastic straws, and a lot of people can't afford to go vegan/vegetarian. I strive to make sure that green policies don't put any pressure on any member of the Selwyn community. Additionally, without a commitee member dedicated to "ethics", we all need to pick up the slack and make sure the JCR does what is right.  </p>
